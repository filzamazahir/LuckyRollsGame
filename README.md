# Lucky Rolls Game
Lucky Rolls Game is an iOS 9 app built in Swift 2. This game is a twist to the classic Snakes and Ladders game. It uses the device accelerometer to roll the die. Players get to roll the die twice and move forward/backward based on the difference between the two rolls. Rolling the die 'harder' also initiates a 'double roll' which would end the game faster. 


# To Run

1) Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/filzamazahir/LuckyRollsGame.git
```

2) Connect your iOS device to your Mac (make sure to have XCode installed). Open the NotesClone.xcode proj file and run it using Command+R or Product -> Run

3) When rolling the die, shake your device horizontally to roll the die. The bar should show at least 75% in order for the roll to register.
